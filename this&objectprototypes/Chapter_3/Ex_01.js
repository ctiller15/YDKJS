// Literal syntax for an object.

var myObj = {
	key: value
	// ...
};

// constructed object.

var myObj = new Object();
myObj.key = value;

// Constructed and literal form create the same sort of object.
// Literal objects can add one or more key/value pairs to the declaration.
// constructed you have to add the properties one by one.
